# OpenLinks

⛓️ Open Links is a Firefox extension for opening a lot of links at once ⛓️  
Based on [an idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/comments/hfjgew/smt_selective_mass_link_opener_for_firefox/) by [/u/ConsolesQuiteAnnoyMe](https://www.reddit.com/user/ConsolesQuiteAnnoyMe).

-   Lists all of the links on a page.
-   Applies a filter to the list of links, optionally using regular expressions.
-   Opens the entire list in tabs.

## TODO

-   Add persistent options.
-   Add a warning when opening way too many links.
-   Make it less ugly.
