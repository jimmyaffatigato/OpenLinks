‚õìÔ∏è OpenLinks is a browser extension for opening a lot of links at once ‚õìÔ∏è  
Based on [an idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/comments/hfjgew/smt_selective_mass_link_opener_for_firefox/) by [/u/ConsolesQuiteAnnoyMe](https://www.reddit.com/user/ConsolesQuiteAnnoyMe).

- Lists all of the links on a page.
- Applies a filter to the list.
- Opens the entire list in tabs.

## Installation

### Firefox

Click "Add to Firefox" at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/openlinks/ to install the most recent version with automatic updates.

Alternatively, you can install the current version or any previous version from the [release page](https://github.com/jimmyaffatigato/OpenLinks/releases). This installation method does not enable automatic updates.

## Instructions

Click the <img alt="OpenLinks" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimmyaffatigato/OpenLinks/default/icons/links-icon-48.png" width="16" /> OpenLinks icon in your browser's toolbar. The resulting popup window will list all of the links in the active tab. This is often **A LOT** of links. Use the filter to avoid potentially opening hundreds of tabs at once.

### Filter

When "Use Regex" is unchecked, the filter matches each link that contains the input string. When "Use Regex" is checked, the filter's input will be interpreted as a regular expression using your browser's built-in [`RegExp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) object.

The "Ignore Case" checkbox determines whether or not the search should match case. The case of the links in the resulting list is not affected.

### Opening Links

Click on any link in the list to open it in a new tab. Primary click will immediately switch to the new tab. Middle click will open it in the background.

Click "OpenLinks" to open **every** link in the list in new tabs. Your browser will probably crash if you try to open too many at once. So don't do that. ü§∑

## Build

### Linux

Requires [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and [`tsc`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

With NPM:  
`npm run build`

Without NPM:  
`cd build`  
`bash build.sh`

This script will:

- Compile `.js` files from `.ts` source.
- Copy add-on files into `./build/dist`.
- Package the contents of `./build/dist` into an `.xpi` file using the name and version from `./src/manifest.json`.

Note: Firefox will reject the created file because it is not signed by Mozilla. Experimental builds can be loaded as a [temporary add-on](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/) in `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.

### Windows

I haven't tried building this on Windows, but the Linux process _might_ work in Powershell with bash on WSL. Presumably, `jq` and `tsc` would need to be accessible in PATH.

## Planned Features

- Better design.
- Warning when opening way too many links.
- Individual select/deselect on links.
- Bookmark links without opening them first.
- Catch duplicate pages with different hashes
